# Soccer_analytics

# Features
1) Detect number of players of each team in a frame
2) Detect soccer ball in the frame

# Player Detection:

1) Train Deep neural network to directly detect and classify the images in the desired category
2) It is more compute optimized due to feature sharing for multiple classes as well as copying data to GPU memory and back to cpu Memory happens only once
3) The network used is yolov5 using COCO pretrained weights

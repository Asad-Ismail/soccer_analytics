# Soccer Analytics
The Repo below is based on excellent OD work  https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
### Features
1) Detect number of players of each team in a frame
2) Detect soccer ball in the frame

Players detection for each team can be done in two major ways

### Detect players using Object detection network and classify using classification network 
1) Train Deep neural network to detect players and classify using a classification network

2) It is more scalaeble since there are number of publically available persons/pedestrian detection dataset that we can use and then classify each detection as belonging to particular team. Clasificaiton labelling is also more time and cost effective.

3) The trained network trained on COCO dataset is used for person detector and ResNet101 is used for further classification.

4) Run train_classifier.py to train the classification network by giving appropriate dataset path

5) Run predictions using
 
"python detect_soccer.py --weights=weights/best.pt --use-class=True --class_weights=clas_weights.pt --source=sample.mp4 --device=0"
Replace wights and class weights by your weights or weights provided

6) The network used is yolov5 using COCO pretrained weights

 Average Time taken is  __110ms__ @GTX1080, CPU G4560 @ 3.50GHz without AVX instructions. The timing includes NMS and argmax operations after detection

### Detect and classify the team players using Object detection network 
1) Train Deep neural network to directly detect and classify the images in the desired category

2) It is more compute optimized due to feature sharing for multiple classes as well as copying data to GPU memory and back to cpu Memory happens only once

3) The network used is yolov5 using COCO pretrained weights and trained on annotated dataset 

4) Use soccer.ipynb to train yolov5 netowrk 

5) Run predictions using 

"python detect_soccer.py --weights=weights/best.pt --use-class=False --source=sample.mp4 --device=0"
Replace wights by your weights or weights provided
